Description:
    The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,

        1**2 + 2**2 + ... + 10**2 = 385

    The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,

        (1 + 2 + ... + 10)**2 = 55**2 = 3025

    Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten
    natural numbers and the square of the sum is 3025 âˆ’ 385 = 2640.

    Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred
    natural numbers and the square of the sum.

    No programming necessary.
