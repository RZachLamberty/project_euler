Description:
    If p is the perimeter of a right angle triangle with integral length sides,
    {a,b,c}, there are exactly three solutions for p = 120.

        {20,48,52}, {24,45,51}, {30,40,50}

    For which value of p â‰¤ 1000, is the number of solutions maximised?

Notes:
    Here are the facts re: the solution p that we know:

        (a, b, c) are such that:

            1.  a + b + c = p
                        c = p - a - b

            2.  a**2 + b**2 = c**2
                          c = sqrt(a**2 + b**2)

            3. a, b, and c are all integers

    Combining (1) and (2), we have that

        a**2 + b**2 = (p - a - b)**2
        a**2 + b**2 = p**2 + a**2 + b**2 - 2pa - 2pb + 2ab
                  0 = p**2 -2p(a + b) + 2ab

    I did this by hand. this yields roots of

        p = a + b +- |c|

    Instead, just kind of brute force it.
